TuneSync
================

**Under Construction**

A Streamlit app that displays my Last.fm music dashboard.

**Features**

* Displays total play count
* Shows currently playing track
* Displays top 3 artists and genres for the selected time period (weekly, monthly, yearly, or overall)

**Usage**

* Clone the repository
* Create a `tokens.json` file with your Last.fm API credentials (see example below)
* Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`

**tokens.json example**

```json
{
    "last_api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "last_secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET",
    "last_username": "YOUR_LAST_FM_USERNAME",
    "last_password": "YOUR_LAST_FM_PASSWORD"
}
```

**Note**: This app is still in development. Functionality and design are subject to change.
